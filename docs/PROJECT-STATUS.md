# RootTrace AI — Project Status

> **Not a specification.** Every other file in `docs/` is binding; this one is a
> snapshot. It records where the build actually is, what is proved, what is
> open, and what to pick up next. Deliberately un-numbered so it is never
> mistaken for part of the frozen contract set.
>
> **Last updated:** 2026-08-17, at commit `9dd46af` (T2.5, Phase 6 closed).
> Regenerate this from `docs/15-V1-BUILD-PLAN.md` and `git log` — those are the
> authorities. If this file and `15` disagree, `15` wins.

## 1. Where the build is, in one line

**Phases 0–6 of 16 are complete.** The system can accept a production error over
HTTP, sanitise it, fingerprint it, group it into an issue, score its severity,
and decide whether it deserves a pipeline run — and it has a Python SDK that
sends those errors from a customer's application. **Nothing downstream of
ingestion exists yet.** No retrieval, no reasoning, no patch, no sandbox, no
dashboard.

**Next:** Phase 7 — retrieval (T4.1–T4.4). The build plan singles it out as the
one that must not be rushed.

---

## 2. Phase status

`15` §2 is the canonical order. Note that Phase 5 (fixtures) deliberately runs
*before* Phase 6 (ingestion), reversed from the ticket numbering.

| Phase | Scope | Tickets | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Specification repair | — | ✅ Complete (`18` §9) |
| 1 | Repository / tooling | T1.1 | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | Supabase schema + RLS | T1.2, T1.3 | ✅ Complete |
| 3 | Auth | T1.4 | ⚠️ Complete **except** refresh-token reuse detection — see §5 |
| 4 | FastAPI foundation | T1.5 | ✅ Complete |
| 5 | Fixture system | T3.1–T3.3 | ✅ Complete |
| 6 | Ingestion / fingerprinting | T2.1–T2.5 | ⚠️ Complete **except** T2.1's p95 budget and object storage — see §5 |
| **7** | **Retrieval** | **T4.1–T4.4** | ⬜ **Not started — next** |
| 8 | AI reasoning | T5.1–T5.3 | ⬜ Not started |
| 9 | Patch generation | T5.4 | ⬜ Not started |
| 10 | Sandbox validation | T6.1–T6.5 | ⬜ Not started |
| 11 | Repair loop | T7.1 | ⬜ Not started |
| 12 | Independent review | T7.2 | ⬜ Not started |
| 13 | Confidence engine | T7.3 | ⬜ Not started |
| 14 | Fixture GitHub transport | T8.1 | ⬜ Not started |
| 15 | Evaluation harness | T10.1 | ⬜ Not started |
| 16 | Dashboard | T8.2–T8.4, T9.1–T9.8 | ⬜ Not started |

**13 tickets closed of 47.** (39 have their own section in `15`; T9.1–T9.8 are
listed as a table in `15` §11.)

Of the 14 pipeline stages in `03`, **stages S1–S3 exist** (`receive`,
`fingerprint`, `triage`). S4 onward do not.

## 3. What is actually built

| Area | State | Proof |
|---|---|---|
| Tooling | `uv` workspace, ruff, mypy `--strict`, pytest, pre-commit, gitleaks, pip-audit, CI on 3 jobs | `make check`, `make audit` |
| Schema | 17 migrations, RLS enabled **and forced** on every tenant table | `tests/integration/test_rls_isolation.py` (82), `test_rls_architecture.py` (10), `test_partitions.py` (9) |
| Auth | `/v1/me`, providers, GoTrue JWT verified against real JWKS | `tests/integration/test_auth_end_to_end.py` |
| API foundation | Request-id middleware, structlog redaction chain, error envelope, container image | `tests/integration/test_container.py`, unit suites |
| Fixtures | 39-module synthetic repo, 25 error payloads + 25 ground-truth files, every bug reproduced by running the code | `make fixtures-verify` (in CI) |
| GitHub client | Full `GitHubGateway` protocol, `FixtureTransport` with **real git object ids**, factory seam enforced by lint-style tests | `apps/worker/tests/test_github_contract.py`, `test_transport_parity.py` |
| Ingest | `POST /v1/events` — auth, rate limit, atomic idempotency claim, per-event validation, sanitisation, batch insert, enqueue | `tests/integration/test_ingest_endpoint.py` (18), `test_ingest_role.py` (16) |
| Fingerprint + issues | Message normalisation, in-app frame extraction, single-statement atomic upsert | `test_issue_upsert.py` (7), incl. 100 concurrent identical inserts |
| Triage | Severity scoring, six gate reasons | `apps/api/tests/test_triage.py` (34) |
| Python SDK | `init`, `capture_exception`, `add_breadcrumb`, ASGI middleware, batching, retry, buffer, never-raises | 171 unit + 13 integration tests |

**Test totals:** 1,164 collected — 576 `unit`, 220 `security`, the rest
`integration`. Overall coverage **88%** against a ratchet of **75**.

## 4. Decisions taken in this session

Fifteen commits, `5c863bc` → `9dd46af`. The decisions worth carrying forward:

### Architecture

- **`rt_ingest` resolves a contradiction in the spec.** S1 runs in `api`; `api`
  must not hold the service-role key; `raw_events` has forced RLS with no
  INSERT grant to `authenticated`; and ingest carries no user JWT. The
  resolution is a dedicated role with **no `BYPASSRLS` and no password**,
  reached by `SET LOCAL ROLE` and scoped by a `WITH CHECK` against
  `rt.project_id`. The database refuses a cross-tenant write even when the
  handler asks for one. The rejected alternative — granting a write-only role
  read access to every project's membership — is recorded in `15` T2.1.
- **The idempotency claim is atomic** (`SET … NX`), never check-then-act. Two
  concurrent retries of one batch cannot both proceed.
- **The issue upsert is one statement**, not read-then-write. Verified by racing
  100 concurrent identical inserts against real Postgres.
- **The triage gate is advisory; the database is authoritative** (B8). The
  losing side of an insert race attaches to the winner and is indistinguishable
  from having been gated. The DB half is deferred to T8.2.
- **The SDK declares zero runtime dependencies**, so its transport is `urllib`
  and its middleware is raw ASGI. The cost is three things duplicated from
  `apps/api`, and `tests/integration/test_sdk_contract_agreement.py` is the
  single place both packages are imported together so drift fails a test.

### Spec deviations, all with the doc updated in the same commit

- `05` §10 said `import roottrace`; the package is **`roottrace_sdk`**, matching
  the distribution name rather than inheriting the `beautifulsoup4`/`bs4`
  papercut.
- `before_send` receives a **`dict`**, not an object — the attribute form needs
  a model class the zero-dependency rule forbids.
- **Local variables are off by default.** `03` §S1 marks `vars` "redacted", but
  redaction happens at ingest, by which point a password held in a plain local
  has already left the customer's process and matches neither the entropy rule
  nor the pattern list.
- `18` §7 pins the canonical fixture defect to lines 38–43 while `A1` §4's
  comment said line 41. **The registry wins**; the code is written to it.
- `A1` §2's file and test counts were wrong (a required test file had been
  dropped, not the count). Corrected to 42 files, 52 tests, 50 passing.

### Controls that looked applied but did nothing — found and fixed

This is the recurring theme of the session and the thing most worth reading:

| What appeared to work | What was actually happening |
|---|---|
| Security coverage gate | `ls apps/api/roottrace_api/auth*.py` matched a file, not the package — the gate had never run. Now 96%. |
| Container image build | `uv export --no-dev` on the workspace root exports nothing; the image built green with **zero dependencies**. Now asserts `fastapi==` is present and runs an import smoke test. |
| `--no-access-log` | Undone by our own `configure_logging`. Silenced in code instead. |
| Coverage measurement | `source = ["apps","packages"]` — coverage only recurses into directories with `__init__.py`, so it measured only modules some test happened to import. A module with no tests was absent, not 0%. |
| `boundary-01` fixture case | Not a bug at all. With 1-based pagination, `offset - 1` is correct. |
| Both control cases | Leaking raw transport exceptions — they would have been *fixable* cases, not controls. |
| `.gitleaks.toml` | Matched `rt_live_` and not `rt_test_`, though `05` §2.1 defines the format as `rt_{live\|test}`. Half a format reports clean on the half it doesn't read. |
| 500-response handling (T1.5) | FastAPI routes `Exception` to `ServerErrorMiddleware`, which sits *outside* user middleware — so 500s had no `X-Request-ID`, no security headers, and a null `request_id`. |

**Every new guard was verified with a deliberate probe**, not assumed: removing
the redaction processor produces 20 failures; adding a `github_mode` branch
fires 2 of 3 parity rules; reintroducing `RT_COVERAGE_MIN_OVERALL` trips the
namespace guard; disabling the new gitleaks rule fails the new test.

### A correction worth remembering

**I claimed the T2.1 p95 budget was met. It was not.** Corrected in `ee8281b`
with the real numbers. Widening the threshold to make the test green was
explicitly rejected — that deletes the only signal.

## 5. Open items, carried forward

| # | Item | Owner ticket | Why it is open |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Refresh-token reuse detection does not work** | T1.4 | Replaying a consumed refresh token returns 200 at `GOTRUE_SECURITY_REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_INTERVAL` of both 10 and 0, suggesting 0 means *unlimited* in this build. A stolen refresh token is replayable; `11` T15's mitigation is incomplete. |
| 2 | **S1 p95 budget not met** | T2.1 | Linux CI: median 28 ms, **p95 226 ms** against a 50 ms target. Bimodal — ~15 samples at 26–33 ms, 5 at 94–230 ms. An unidentified periodic stall, so a real defect rather than platform cost. `xfail(strict=False)` with the numbers in the reason. |
| 3 | **Object storage (S1 step 8) not implemented** | T2.1 → worker | `payload_url` is null. The `api` holds no credential that can write to Supabase Storage, by the same boot invariant that keeps the service-role key out of it. The archive write belongs to the worker. |
| 4 | **Triage is not DB-wired** | T2.4 → T8.2 | The B8 insert-and-handle-conflict path needs the `investigations` table and its partial unique index, which belong to the orchestrator. |
| 5 | **Fixture tree has one revision on disk** | T3.3 | `ref` is resolved, validated and recorded but does not select content. `blame` and `compare` do distinguish revisions. Nothing in V1 reads a historical ref. |
| 6 | **Fixture suite verified against stock `python:3.12-slim`, not the hardened image** | T3.1 → T6.1 | Checked with `--network none`, which is the property T6.1 would otherwise inherit as a surprise. Re-verify at T6.1. |
| 7 | **`replay` and `live` transports raise `TransportUnavailable`** | V2 | Deliberate. They are listed and skipped in the contract suite rather than omitted — an omitted transport is one nobody remembers to add. |

---

## 6. Known documentation drift

Small, and recorded rather than silently fixed:

- `docs/00-README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` both describe `A4-ADR-LOG.md` as holding
  **eight** decisions. It holds **twelve** (ADR-001 … ADR-012), and has since
  the specification baseline. `CLAUDE.md` is yours, so it is untouched.

---

## 7. Environment notes

- **Local Supabase is currently wedged on Windows.** `supabase start` fails to
  bind port 54322 because Windows' NAT service has reserved the range
  54313–54412. Kong stays "Up" while refusing connections, and the integration
  suite blocks on the first test that reaches it rather than failing. Fix and
  diagnosis are in `A3` §5; it needs `net stop winnat && net start winnat` from
  an **elevated** shell, which briefly drops port forwarding for every container
  on the machine.
- Redis runs on **6380**, not 6379 — binding the default would risk pointing the
  suite at an unrelated project's Redis, which the idempotency tests flush.
- CI is authoritative for the DB-backed integration suite and is green on
  `9dd46af` across all three jobs.

### Commands

```bash
make check              # fmt · lint · typecheck · unit + coverage ratchet
make audit              # gitleaks (full history) · pip-audit · action-pin check
make test-integration   # needs the local Supabase stack + Redis
make test-security      # RLS, tenancy, injection corpus
make fixtures-verify    # ground truth resolved against real code (also in CI)
```

## 8. What to continue with

**Phase 7 — retrieval, T4.1 → T4.4, in order.** `15` §6 has the acceptance
criteria; `03` §S4/§S5 has the contracts.

| Ticket | Scope |
|---|---|
| T4.1 | Stage 4 — `understand` |
| T4.2 | Frame path resolution |
| T4.3 | Stage 5 — retrieval strategies A, B, D, E |
| T4.4 | Ranking, budget, and quality scoring |

**The rule that governs this phase**, from `CLAUDE.md` and `15` §14:

> Do not advance past Phase 7 until it is genuinely good on the fixture set.
> Everything downstream inherits its errors, and a confident wrong answer built
> on wrong context passes every later gate.

Two things are already in place to make that measurable, and both should be used
rather than re-derived: the **25-case corpus** with AST-resolved ground truth
(`fixtures/error-corpus/`, `make fixtures-verify`), and the **fixture GitHub
client**, which is the only way retrieval reaches code. P3 binds here — retrieve
narrowly, never wholesale, inside a hard 24,000-token budget with
priority-ordered eviction.

Nothing in the open-items list blocks Phase 7.
